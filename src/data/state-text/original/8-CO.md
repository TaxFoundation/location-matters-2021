Despite its low, single-rate corporate income tax and modest unemployment insurances taxes, Colorado imposes higher-than-average tax burdens on all firm types except mature technology centers, with the state ranking last overall for new firms. These high effective tax rates are driven in large part by the state’s high commercial property taxes. Even where lower taxes elsewhere are successful in mitigating property tax impacts, as with mature distribution centers, the state still ranks 40th. The benefit of a low corporate rate is also diminished by a throwback rule, exposing more income to in-state taxation.

Colorado’s property taxes are consistently high across firm types, due to a split roll system of taxation under which commercial properties are taxed using an assessment ratio that is more than four times higher than the assessment ratio that applies to residential property. These high property tax rates are further exacerbated by the inclusion of equipment in the property tax base.

This tax structure is particularly burdensome to manufacturing firms. The new capital-intensive manufacturing operation sees effective property tax rates nearly three times the national average, while the mature capital-intensive manufacturing operation and both labor-intensive manufacturing operations see effective property tax rates around twice the national average.

Colorado offers both job creation and investment incentives for qualifying new firms, but such incentives provide relatively little benefit to the firms we modeled. The state does not offer research and development (R&D) tax credits, so consequently, the mature R&D firm sees a slightly above-average tax burden, while the new R&D firm experiences a significantly higher-than-average tax burden, ranking 43rd among states.

Colorado’s sales tax is unique, with its low state rate far outstripped by local rates. Consequently, the location a firm chooses within Colorado can be highly significant in terms of sales tax liability.

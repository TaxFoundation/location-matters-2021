Connecticut imposes an above-average tax burden on all model firms except mature labor-intensive operations, due in large part to the state’s high corporate income tax rate. A 10 percent corporate surtax, bringing the effective rate to 8.25 percent, expired at the start of 2021, though lawmakers were debating its extension at the time of this writing.

The state’s investment credit and research and development (R&D) credit cannot overcome the state’s high statutory tax rates for new R&D facilities, leading to their rank of 49th in the category. Mature R&D facilities fare marginally better but still rank in the bottom 10.

Connecticut ranks 27th for mature labor-intensive manufacturing firms, which have a total effective tax rate of 10.9 percent, just under the 11.1 percent national average. These comparatively lighter tax costs are assisted by Connecticut’s single sales factor income apportionment formula and the lack of a throwback rule. The state does, however, extend its property tax base to include equipment, which leads to above-average tax burdens on capital-intensive manufacturers. Connecticut ranks 38th for mature capital-intensive manufacturing with an above-average effective rate of 19.9 percent, and the new labor-intensive firm ranks 41st.

The inclusion of equipment in the property tax base, in addition to high unemployment insurance tax burdens, drives the state’s 44th place ranking for new shared services centers, and 42nd for mature operations. Finally, Connecticut has begun phasing out its capital stock tax but still currently imposes the second-highest capital stock tax in the country. It is one of only 15 states imposing such a tax, which can greatly hinder capital formation.

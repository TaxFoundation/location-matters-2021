Alabama is one of the top five states for new firms, while mature firms tend to experience average overall tax burdens. However, the mature technology center and labor-intensive manufacturer face burdens slightly higher than average, and the research and development (R&D) facility and data center see very high comparative tax burdens.

This general advantage comes despite the state’s throwback rule, as well as its throwout rule on service receipts. Notably, Alabama changed its apportionment formula to single sales factor in 2021, relieving some of the burden on firms that do business primarily outside the state.

Alabama generally imposes a below-average income tax burden on the firm types we modeled. However, mature R&D facilities are a notable exception, and the difference between new and mature firms of that category is stark. New facilities face the seventh lowest effective income tax rate of -8.0 percent (reflecting incentives exceeding tax liability), while mature firms rank 50th with a 7.1 percent effective rate. While the state does not provide any tax credits specifically aimed at R&D activities, Alabama provides many general incentives that would apply to a new R&D facility but would not apply to a mature firm.

Manufacturing machinery and R&D equipment is subject to the sales tax in Alabama, which is a detriment to capital-intensive firms, but manufacturing machinery is taxed at a reduced sales tax rate.

Distribution centers fare particularly well in Alabama, with mature operations ranking third nationwide. The state’s lowest-in-the-country property taxes of 9.8 percent for mature distribution centers yield a property tax bill 64 percent below the national median of 27.5 percent. Low property tax burdens are also an important contributing factor in the low tax burdens experienced by shared service centers.

Alabama is one of 15 states with an antiquated capital stock tax, hindering capital formation.

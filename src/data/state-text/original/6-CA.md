California imposes high tax burdens on mature manufacturing centers and above-average burdens on mature corporate headquarters and data centers. However, most other mature businesses see lower-than-average tax burdens. Mature research and development (R&D) centers and technology centers each rank within the top 10 for their firm types, and the shared services center ranks second in its category with an effective rate of 13.8 percent.

The state’s high income and sales taxes drive up tax costs for firms whose employees and sales are within the state’s borders, which is why, despite the state’s single sales factor apportionment, both capital- and labor-intensive manufacturing operations perform poorly, ranking in the bottom 10 for both new and mature operations. The new corporate headquarters, hit particularly hard by the state’s high corporate income tax, ranks 35th with a 19.9 percent effective tax rate.

Conversely, the state’s favorable benefits-received sourcing rules, along with relatively low property and unemployment insurance tax burdens, help the mature shared service center rank second-best in the nation for its firm type. Due to these sourcing rules, very little of these firms’ income is exposed to California’s high statutory tax rates. The mature distribution center similarly benefits from these provisions, ranking 17th.

Generous incentives lower the corporate income tax burden for new research and development (R&D) facilities in the state, but they and all other firm types that do business primarily in-state see corporate income tax burdens that are significantly above the national average. Beyond R&D credits, however, California is notable for having very few tax incentives for newly established operations. Although incentives can lower costs for new firms, that cost is shifted to mature operations, which could result in prohibitive tax burdens in a state that already imposes unusually high taxes.

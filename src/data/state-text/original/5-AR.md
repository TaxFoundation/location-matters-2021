While many mature firms in Arkansas experience lower-than-average tax burdens, data centers and manufacturing firms see high burdens, as the state has high sales taxes, unfavorable service sourcing rules for most firms, and a throwback rule.

Arkansas is one of the few states to tax both equipment and inventories under its property tax, though property tax rates in the state tend to be fairly low, keeping the effective property tax burden modest. However, new manufacturing firms receive a generous abatement of their property tax burden. New data centers do not receive the same benefit, which contributes to their 45th-place ranking.

Manufacturing firms experience particularly high tax burdens in Arkansas, which can be attributed to a high combined state and local sales tax rate, an antiquated capital stock tax, and an above-average corporate income tax burden on manufacturing. The mature labor-intensive manufacturing operation ranks 39th nationwide with an effective tax rate of 14.2 percent, while the mature capital-intensive operation experiences a 19.7 percent tax burden, ranking 44th nationwide.

Arkansas offers sizable withholding tax rebates and generous investment and job tax credits for newly established businesses, and manufacturing machinery is exempt from the sales tax for new or expanded facilities. In fact, all newly-established model firms except for data centers receive tax incentives that more than offset income tax liability, yielding refunds that can be used to offset other tax liabilities as well.

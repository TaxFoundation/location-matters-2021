All of our model firms experience below-average tax costs for mature operations in Arizona. The state’s apportionment formula provides a choice between single sales factor and double-weighted sales factor apportionment. The state does not impose a throwback rule but does have unfavorable sourcing rules for Arizona firms selling services out of state.

Arizona is one of only a handful of states not to offer property tax abatements to new firms, which helps drive the above-average effective tax burdens for new manufacturing operations but also enables the state to have lower, more neutral taxes over the course of a firm’s existence. Mature manufacturing firms experience low tax burdens in Arizona—9.0 percent for mature capital-intensive manufacturing operations, compared to 17.6 percent for new operations—despite a property tax that includes equipment. The new firm’s higher tax burden is driven by initial expenses and acquisitions that are subject to tax.

Even given the relative dearth of incentives (such as property tax abatements and investment credits), new operations tend to see near-average tax burdens. Mature operations, many of which experience a low corporate income tax burden in particular, see below-average burdens.

The state offers both a job creation credit and a research and development (R&D) incentive. Furthermore, manufacturing machinery and R&D equipment are exempt from the sales tax, which also assists in keeping tax costs modest for these firms, and particularly for new firms with more upfront equipment costs.

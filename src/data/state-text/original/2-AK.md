Alaska’s high 9.4 percent top corporate income tax rate is exacerbated for most firms by the state’s evenly weighted three-factor apportionment formula. The state also imposes a throwback rule on the sale of goods into states with which a firm lacks nexus, and sources service income to the location of the income-producing activity, subjecting most service income to in-state taxation. Alaska forgoes an individual income tax, which can be of significance to individuals and pass-through entities, although it has no bearing on the firms in our study.

By also doing without a state-level sales tax, Alaska benefits data centers, which often see their equipment subject to sales tax in other states. Given Alaska’s location, data processing will mainly serve Alaska-centric companies, but even that smaller number of data centers will reap the benefits of not having a sales tax.

Conversely, high corporate income tax and unemployment insurance tax burdens drive up tax costs for many firms, including manufacturing operations, R&D facilities, and call centers. The mature labor-intensive manufacturer ranks 38th nationwide with a 13.6 percent effective tax rate.

Alaska’s property tax base varies by locality, but can include equipment and inventory, increasing costs for many firms. Alaska largely eschews incentives for newly established operations, which yields relatively similar tax burdens for new and mature firms for all companies except the capital-intensive manufacturer, where the new firm faces far lower income tax burdens due to its ability to expense new investments.
